The quality of all releases distributed through Endelium is of the utmost importance to us. In order to maintain our high standards and comply with Digital Service Provider requirements, we have devised the following Asset Requirements with which all releases must comply.

Should you have any questions about these or anything else, please speak with your Account Manager or [contact us](/contact) and we'd be glad to help.
