We have partnered with a CD Duplication & Replication Services provider to offer physical products at reasonable rates to our clients. We are also able to provide Physical Distribution, though this is by separate arrangement - please consult with your Account Manager about this.

For clients utilising our Duplication & Replication services, the requirements are below.

If you are looking for our Digital Asset Requirements, please click [here](/clients/digital-asset-requirements).

## Audio Files

Wherever possible, a DDP image should be provided for your release, as this will be required when sending it off to the replication centre. If you do not have one available, then our team can produce one for you.

Additionally, we require that audio masters are provided for each track. These should be formatted as follows:

|Object|Requirement|
|--------|-------------|
|Format|PCM/WAV|
|Bit Depth|16-bit|
|Sample Rate|44.1 kHz **only**|

Note that these are different to the requirements for digital distribution, which can be found [here](/clients/digital-asset-requirements).

## Artwork

You can find detailed spec sheets / templates for all product types at the link below:

All of our spec sheets are sized accurately, so if you're using software such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator you just need to place our PDF onto one layer and then design your artwork on the layer above.

Please make sure that your artwork meets the following requirements:

|Object|Requirement|
|------|-----------|
|Size|Use spec sheet / template|
|Resolution|300dpi|
|Colour mode|CMYK (**NOT** RGB)|
|Format|Preferred: PDF<br>Acceptable: JPEG<br>_Provide both where possible._|

We recommend that most pages use a light background and a dark text colour. This not only helps with legibility, but also reduces the chance of errors occurring during the print. Be mindful of the amount of ink required to print your artwork.

If your artwork has already been designed using someone else's template or spec sheet, don't worry. Send it over so we can check it, and there's every chance we'll be able to use it.

Where you plan to sell your CDs, or we are doing so on your behalf, the following additional requirements apply:

* MCPS's AP1/AP2 form MUST have been completed and/or clearance received by Endelium from publisher via direct e-mail or posted branded letter
* The title presented on the artwork MUST match that in the metadata
* A full track listing, including timings, MUST be included if a booklet is printed
* Full production credits MUST be included if a booklet is printed
* An EAN barcode must be placed in the bottom right corner of the back cover

Should you require any assistance in creating your artwork, please contact your Account Manager.
